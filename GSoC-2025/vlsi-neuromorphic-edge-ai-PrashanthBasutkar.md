Project proposal
•	Synopsis
Neuromorphic computing emulates the neural architecture of the human brain to enable low-power, event-driven computation. This project focuses on the design and development of a neuromorphic VLSI system optimized for Edge AI applications. It will implement a simple spiking neural network (SNN) architecture using CMOS-compatible analog/digital circuitry to process real-time data with ultra-low power consumption. The aim is to deliver a functional prototype (e.g., on FPGA or simulated ASIC) for applications such as gesture recognition, environmental monitoring, or low-power IoT devices. The open-source community will benefit from accessible hardware designs and SNN models deployable in constrained edge environments.
•	Implementation timeline
Minimal Deliverables
•	SNN model selection and simulation in software
•	VLSI architecture for neuron and synapse circuits
•	RTL/analog design and simulation (Verilog/SystemVerilog + Cadence tools)
•	FPGA-based prototype or analog simulation results
•	Documentation and tutorials
Stretch Goals
•	Hardware-software co-design interface (e.g., SPI/I2C)
•	Benchmarking vs. conventional architectures
•	Support for online learning (STDP or similar)

Communication plan
Weekly sync-ups with the mentor via video call, plus asynchronous updates through Zulip or Discord. Daily or alternate-day updates via chat for blockers. GitHub issues and milestones to track progress.
Personal statement
•	Past experience I have hands-on experience with Verilog, digital IC design flows, and basic analog CMOS circuits through academic projects. I've used FPGA boards (e.g., Xilinx Spartan/Artix) and am familiar with ML frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow. I’ve also contributed to open-source repositories related to AI models and RTL cores.
•	Motivation: why this project? I’m deeply fascinated by bio-inspired computing. Neuromorphic systems are the next frontier for low-power, intelligent hardware, and this project is a rare opportunity to contribute to that domain while blending my interests in AI and chip design.
•	Match: why you? I bring a unique blend of skills: circuit design, FPGA prototyping, and AI modelling. My previous work with low-power RTL design and passion for neuroscience-inspired computing makes me a strong candidate.
•	Availability I have no full-time work during GSoC. I may have some minor academic commitments, but I can allocate 18–20 hours per week consistently for the duration.
GSoC
•	GSoC experience I expect to gain mentorship, real-world open-source development experience, and deeper insights into neuromorphic hardware design. I also hope to contribute long-term to the project after GSoC.
•	Are you also applying to projects with other organisations in GSoC 2025? No, this is my only application, and my top priority.
